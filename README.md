# Solitaire-Encryption
In Neal Stephensonâ€™s novel Cryptonomicon,two of the main characters are able to covertly communicate with one another 
with a deck of playing cards (including the jokers) and knowledge of the Solitaire encryption algorithm, which was created 
(in real life) by Bruce Schneier.

This is a simple version of the same algorithm. A deck of cards is used by the sender and the receiver.
The arrangement of the cards should be the same on both sides.
Moreover the cards used are from 1-28 rather than the whole deck i.e 52.
